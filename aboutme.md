 Hi, I am Florence! You can also call me Flo. 
 
 I'm a software engineer specializing in full-stack development. I have always had a passion for software development. I co-created Layr: A decentralized p2p cloud file storage network. I have also completed other freelance projects in the past. I am proficient in JavaScript, Node.js, Ruby, Rails, React, Redux and HTML&CSS. 
 
 When I am not coding, you will find me doing High Intensity Interval Training, pilates, playing with cats, or playing piano. 
 
 I also write about technical articles to share my understandings toward specific topics, you can find out from <a href="https://medium.com/@florenceliang/">here</a>.
 
 Feel free to [contact me](mailto:florence.liang0617d@gmail.com) any time.
