## About me
Hi, my name is Florence. I am a Software Engineer based in the SF Bay area. My career interests lie at the intersection of full-stack development and applied machine learning/AI systems. Having built enterprise-scale web applications (React/TypeScript, Spring Boot) and data-intensive services (Druid, Redis) at Salesforce, I'm now actively expanding into ML/AI engineering. I aim to leverage my expertise in distributed systems and real-time data processing to ML infrastructure for production-grade AI applications.
